1. Go to this URL.
	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/packages/Fedora-Container-Base/38/  
2. Download the most current build, at the time of writing it's Fedora 38.
3. Extract the contents of the .tar.xz file using WinRAR.
4. Locate the layer.tar file within.
5. Copy it to an easy location to navigate to (you'll need this in the terminal so make it as easy as you can) and rename it to something memorable. In this case, I called it fedora38.tar and placed it on the C:\ drive for easy access.
6. Open Windows Terminal into PowerShell. 


wsl --import (distribution) (install location) (file location and filename)

wsl --import fedora38 c:\wsl c:\fedora38.tar

Like on desktop Fedora, one of the first things to do after you're set up is to add the RPMFusion repos. For reasons there are packages that Fedora cannot distribute built into the operating system, and these mostly live inside RPMFusion. 

sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
